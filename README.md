# Email-Spam-Classifier

## Description

This is a Machine Learning Project used to classify Spam Mails from any given mail. Here, I have used Naive Bayes Algorithm model to classify whether a mail is spam or not.
<br>This project is completely done in Python and using libraries numpy, pandas, scickit-learn, pickle, flask, etc.<br><br>
A web version of this project is deployed using Heroku and can be used to real world email texts.
